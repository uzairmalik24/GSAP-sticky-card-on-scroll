# GSAP Sticky Cards Scroll Animation

Hey, I’m **Uzair Malik** 👋  

I’m a passionate developer creating interactive web experiences with modern tech like **GSAP**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Lenis**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project demonstrates a **smooth scroll-triggered sticky card animation** where cards pin, scale, rotate, and fade as you scroll, creating a cinematic and interactive feel.
